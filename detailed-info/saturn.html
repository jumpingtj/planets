        <p id="Formation-paragraph">
            Saturn formed together with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to create the gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system.

        </a>
        <p id="Composition-paragraph">Saturn is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, though some metals, like iron and nickel, and hot rocks nearer the core. There is thought to be a solid core about the size of Earth in the very center of the planet.
