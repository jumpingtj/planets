Jupiter does not have a solid surface being comprised mostly out of swirling gases and liquids such as 90% hydrogen, 10% helium – very similar to the sun. It is now known if Jupiter has a core and recent analysis suggests that the atmosphere extends up
to 3.000 km / 1.864 mi down, and beneath this is an ocean of metallic hydrogen going all the way down to the center. About 80-90% of its radius is now believed to be liquid or technically - electrically conducting plasma – it may be similar to liquid
mercury. The Juno mission will reveal more about Jupiter’s inner structure and if indeed it has a core. Atmosphere The atmosphere of Jupiter is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, spanning over 5.000 km / 3.000 mi in altitude. It is
perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions sub-divided into lighter-hued zones
and darker belts. Because of their interactions, having conflicting circulation patterns, storms and turbulences are created. Wind speeds of 100 m/s – 360 km/h are common in the zonal jets. The cloud layer is only about 50 km / 31 mi deep, consisting
of at least 2 decks of clouds – a thin clearer region and a lower thick one. The upper atmosphere is calculated to be comprised of about 88-92% hydrogen and 8-12% helium. Since helium atoms have more mass than hydrogen atoms, the composition changes.
The atmosphere is thus estimated to be approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium with the remaining 1% of the mass consisting of other elements such as methane, water vapor, ammonia, silicon-based compounds, carbon, ethane, oxygen and more. The outermost
layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia. The interior denser materials by mass are roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium and 5% other elements. These atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition
of the primordial solar nebula. Magnetosphere The magnetic field of Jupiter is fourteen times stronger than that of Earth. It ranges from 4.2 gauss / 0.42 mT at the equator to 10-14 gauss / 1.0 – 1.4 mT at the poles. This makes Jupiter’s magnetic field
the strongest in the Solar System, with the exception of some phenomenon named “sunspots”, that occur on the Sun that are even stronger. It is believed that the liquid metallic hydrogen present in Jupiter is responsible for this along with the volcanic
activity present on Jupiter’s moon Io that emits large amounts of sulfur dioxide forming a gas torus along the moon’s orbit. This gas is ionized in the magnetosphere and through different influences creates a plasma sheet in Jupiter’s equatorial plane.
This causes the deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that of a magnetodisk. As a result, the aurora of Jupiter is stronger as well. It produces almost a million Megawatts – Earth’s aurora, in comparison, produces about 1.000 Megawatts. The combination
of the powerful magnetic field and the charged particles from Io in the plasma torus creates the brightest auroras in the solar system. Sadly, most of them can only be seen through ultraviolet. Because Jupiter is surrounded by this plasma torus, produced
by its strong magnetic field, it makes it very difficult for a spacecraft to approach the planet, yet some zones are not so dangerous but the radiation is still present. Climate Data suggests that the temperature on Jupiter varies from -145 degrees Celsius
/ -234 degrees Fahrenheit in the clouds too much higher temperatures near the planet’s center. Some estimates concluded that it would get even hotter than the surface of the Sun. One of the key features of Jupiter is its Great Red Spot. A storm that’s
existed since 1831, and possibly since 1665. This oval-shaped object is greater in size than Earth and rotates counterclockwise within a period of six days. Its maximum altitude is about 8 km / 5 mi above the surrounding cloud tops. Since its discovery,
it has decreased in size and recent observations state that it decreases in length by about 930 km / 580 mi per year. Storms are common on Jupiter, some are small and last hours while others are huge and last for centuries. Wind speeds of 100 m/s – 360
km/h are common on certain parts of the planet.
